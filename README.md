# Cubes-upon-Cubes-VJ-Software
This is the VJ software I'm using at the moment. Constantly updating as I do shows. 
Please use for your general VJ-ing education. I found it was very hard to find VJ software online, so I present this. Flaws and all! I take no responcibility for the shoddy code. 
Whilst I can code at some level of decent standard, this is a VJ hacky jam thing I made and have had no time to refactor. 
It's my special little untidy monster *scruffles head* so you'll have to accept it as that ^ _ ^

Please do not use for performances or for monetary gain/commercial use. 
Please email me if you have any questions regarding any potential commercial use.
I'd prefer that you all work on your own art pieces and use that. 
I hope that my work might give you some technical insight or some inspiration :)

Feel free to contact me if you have questions about the code.
I can't promise I'll be able to answer but I'll certainly try if I have time!

Oh right, if you want me to VJ around Europe somewhere let me know ;)

Stay cool, VJ troopers <3
